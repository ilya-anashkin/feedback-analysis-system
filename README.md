Feedback Analysis System is a machine learning-powered application designed to analyze textual feedback and determine its sentiment. The system enables businesses to extract actionable insights from customer reviews, providing a deeper understanding of customer sentiments through visual analytics.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Automatically classify feedback as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Leverages advanced NLP models to process text effectively.
- **Visualization with Grafana**: Insights and metrics are presented through Grafana dashboards for better interpretability.
- **Customizable Models**: Train and adapt the model for domain-specific feedback.
